# The uploads directory is needed for storing user-uploaded files like:
# - Bill photos and documents
# - Vehicle photos (before/after unloading)
# - Evidence photos for transfers and processes
# - Cleaning log photos (before/after cleaning)
# - Loading and delivery proof photos

# This directory should be writable by the web server
# In production, consider using cloud storage services
